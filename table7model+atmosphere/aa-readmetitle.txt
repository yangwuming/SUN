Models include atmosphere structure in which is assumed to have the same element abundances and rotation 
rate as convection zone has.  
Neglect the first line. It is artificial dat.
if He=0, you can calculate it by Y=1-X-Z(I forgot output Y for some models).
The models cop11r-edd and copal11r-edd use Eddington atmosphere. Other models with K-S T-\tau relation.
